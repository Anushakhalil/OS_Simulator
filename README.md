# OS Simulator App

This is a flutter project, which will provide an interface through which you can simulate multiple OS Algorithms.
One can use this interface for my previous project, an OS_Flask_API which has multiple OS-Algorithms. To clone that repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anushakhalil/OS-Flask-API
```

## How To Use
1. Install Android Studio
2. Install flutter and dart plugins

3. Then clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anushakhalil/OS_Simulator
```
4. Open the project on any editor i.e VSCode or Android Studio
5. Launch the from Android Studio
6. Then Run the command on the terminal to start the app.
```bash
flutter run
```
### App Interface
1. Cpu-Sheduling <br/>
    - Algorithms (FCFS, SJF, Priority, RR)
    - Type (Non-p, p)  

    Algo-details <br/>
        - Process Name
        - Arrival Time
        - Burst Time

2. Process Synchronization (Semaphore)  <br/>
    - Initial Processes
    - Post Processes

3. Deadlock Detection <br/>
    - Number of processes
    - Processes:
        - Start Edge
        - End Edge

4. Bankers-Algorithm <br/>
    - TotalWorkVector
    - AvailableWorkVector
    - Processes:
        - Process Name
        - Need Vector

5. Fitting <br/>
    - Type (FIRST FIt, BEST FIT, WORST FIT)
    - Processes:
        - Process Size
        - Block Size

3. Page-Replacement <br/>
    - Type (FIFO, OPTIMAL, LRU)
    - ReferenceString
