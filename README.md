# OS Simulator App

This is a flutter project, which will provide an interface through which you can simulate multiple OS Algorithms.
One can use this interface for my previous project, an OS_Flask_API which has multiple OS-Algorithms. To clone that repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anushakhalil/OS-Flask-API
```

## How To Use
1. Install Android Studio
2. Install flutter and dart plugins

3. Then clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anushakhalil/OS_Simulator
```

4. Open the project on any editor i.e VSCode or Android Studio
5. Launch the from Android Studio
6. Then Run the command on the terminal to start the app.
```bash
flutter run
```

### App Interface
- MainMenu Page <br/>
    The main menu page contains:
    1. Cpu-Sheduling <br/>
    2. Process Synchronization (Semaphore)
    3. Deadlock Detection
    4. Bankers-Algorithm
    5. Fitting-Algorithm
    6. Page-Replacement

<!-- 1. Cpu-Sheduling <br/>
    - Algorithms (FCFS, SJF, Priority, RR)
    - Type (Non-p, p)

Under Cpu-Sheduling comes the algo-details screen    
Algo-details <br/>
    - Process Name
    - Arrival Time
    - Burst Time

2. Process Synchronization (Semaphore)  <br/>
    - Initial Processes
    - Post Processes

3. Deadlock Detection <br/>
    - Number of processes
    - Processes:
        - Start Edge
        - End Edge

4. Bankers-Algorithm <br/>
    - TotalWorkVector
    - AvailableWorkVector
    - Processes:
        - Process Name
        - Need Vector

5. Fitting-Algorithm <br/>
    - Type (FIRST FIt, BEST FIT, WORST FIT)
    - Processes:
        - Process Size
        - Block Size


![7](https://github.com/Anushakhalil/OS_Simulator/tree/master/images/pic_7.png "Screen image for Fitting-Algorithm")


3. Page-Replacement <br/>
    - Type (FIFO, OPTIMAL, LRU)
    - ReferenceString
